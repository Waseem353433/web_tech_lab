During this lab, I learned how to use Git to track changes in my project. 
I practiced creating new files, editing them, and committing changes to the repository. 
I also learned how to work with branches by creating an experimental branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch. 
Overall, this lab helped me understand version control and how to manage project files efficiently.
